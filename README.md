# React Project Requirements

These are the requirements for the Phase 3 React project for the Flex course at
[DigitalCrafts] Houston. It is focused on using [React.js] with [Redux].

> NOTE: This project is completed in accordance with the requirements laid out
  below in order to fulfill Texas state requirements for credit for the course.

## Project Description

This web application uses [React.js] and [Redux] to create a team building experience by allowing members to sign up for and attend a random lunch group with colleagues.

Members RSVP to the event and receive an Outlook calendar hold (future feature).  On the morning of the event, the app randomly sorts members into lunch groups for the day.  Members can preview the profiles of other people in their lunch group.

## Project Requirements

- [React.js] and [Redux] to manage the state of a frontend application.
- https://react-redux.js.org/

## Bonus Requirements

-  external library, loaded via `npm`
  - [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), etc


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
